A series of functions were added from `sunkit_image.asda` by declassing the code.
Previously, if one has to make objects of class ``Asda`` and ``Lamb_Oseen`` to implement asda.
Now, all the functions are now declassed, now no object creation is required
to implement any functionality of asda.
Following functions were declassed:
    1. ``gen_vel``
    2. ``gamma_values``
    3. ``center_edge``
    4. ``vortex_property``
    5. ``get_grid``
    6. ``get_vtheta``
    7. ``get_vradial``
    8. ``get_vxvy``
